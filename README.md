### Install and add to Path

To install it automatically you must go to: `/install/x64/Debug/Install.exe`
hen you will have to enter a directory where you want to install the Iptracker and then add it to the Path (executable under cmd)
And There you go ! You can then execute it under the cmd as argument `Iptracker`

### ⚠️Attention⚠️ I would not tolerate that someone has skid my script. I would obviously like you not to copy-paste my script and change the author names. Thanks very much.
